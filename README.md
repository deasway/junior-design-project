# Space Dinosaur Project

It is a widely accepted fact that the worlds of science fiction and scientific research are related in some way. However, this relationship has proven difficult to quantify.

This project will seek to use web scraping to parse various science databases for references to science fiction works, concepts, and authors that have influenced modern technologies. This archive will then be used to produce statistical models that demonstrate how the world of speculative science fiction and modern scientific thought are hardwired at the most basic levels.
